### ✨ A little about me

I’m a **sophomore Information Systems student** who enjoys turning raw numbers into stories that actually *mean* something.  
I work at the intersection of **data, business, and decision-making**, with a growing interest in **analytics-driven product thinking**.

I like projects where patterns aren’t obvious at first — the kind that reward curiosity, structure, and a bit of persistence.
