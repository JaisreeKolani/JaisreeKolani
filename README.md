### Summary

I’m a sophomore Information Systems student who enjoys extracting clarity from complexity.  
My work focuses on analyzing financial and operational data to inform decisions, surface inefficiencies, and design systems that scale logically rather than loudly.

I’m especially drawn to problems where numbers, structure, and human behavior intersect.
